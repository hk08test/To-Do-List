# Mini To-Do List App

This project is a Mini To-Do List Application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed as a practical exercise to strengthen front-end web development skills. The application allows users to add tasks, remove individual tasks, and reset the entire list, providing a complete and interactive user experience. It is fully responsive and styled with modern design principles to make task management visually appealing and intuitive.

# Features

**Add Task**: Users can type a new task in the input field and either click the “Add a Task” button or press the Enter key to insert it into the list.

**Close Individual Task**: Each task includes a styled “X” button, allowing users to remove tasks one by one.

**Reset List**: A dedicated “Reset” button clears all tasks while keeping the main interface intact.

**Keyboard Support**: The app supports keyboard interaction, letting users quickly add tasks using the Enter key, making task entry fast and convenient.

# Modern Design & UX

The application emphasizes modern UI/UX principles, with smooth animations, responsive layouts, and subtle hover effects. Buttons change color and scale slightly on hover to give users feedback and improve interactivity. The layout is fully flexible, adapting to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices. The input field automatically keeps focus after each task is added, allowing users to continue typing without extra clicks, streamlining the workflow.

# Learning Value

This project represents a key milestone in my web development journey, bridging the gap between theoretical learning and practical application. It allowed me to:

Master DOM manipulation in JavaScript for dynamic content creation and deletion.

Implement event listeners for buttons and keyboard input.

Apply CSS flexbox, responsive design, and modern styling techniques.

Understand user experience considerations, such as focus management and interactive feedback.

By building this project, I enhanced my ability to create interactive, user-friendly applications from scratch, applying core front-end technologies. It serves as a foundation for more advanced projects, including React-based apps, and demonstrates a practical understanding of creating functional and visually appealing interfaces.
